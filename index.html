    <br /><br />
I came across your available position for Front-end Engineer while browsing Indeed.com’s job postings and have decided to apply for that position. Upon review of this webpage you will find that I am highly capable of this role and may very well be an excellent fit with Grow.
I graduated from UBC in 2013 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering and shortly thereafter accepted a management position at a large industrial bakery (Weston Bakeries). Although I excelled in this role and gained satisfaction from my successes, I felt that this career path did not play to my strengths (or interests) and decided to leave my position this past summer after training my replacement.<br /><br />

I soon thereafter became interested in mobile applications but quickly moved to the broader world of  web development, finding that the engineering skillset I gained from my undergrad applied surprisingly well to coding. More importantly, I found that I really enjoyed writing code, and I knew this was the career that I wanted to pursue. I began the project-based FreeCodeCamp curriculum in September and completed it in November, finishing the estimated 400+ hour program in six weeks. <br /><br />

Upon completion of the FreeCodeCamp Front-end program I began my personal project, Thai Tutor, a React based single page application largely inspired by the time I spent in Thailand from October to December of 2016. More details can be read at the ‘My Project’ page of the application. Another recent project I have completed is my <a href="https://raddog25.github.io/weatherApp/" target="_blank" >weatherApp</a> which better showcases my ability to handle AJAX and ES6.<br /><br />

Although my professional experience as a developer is admittedly limited, I am positive that I can offer value that other candidates cannot. I am a ruthless problem solver who thrives when challenged, and am becoming a better web developer every single day.

            <p>
                Thai Tutor has been my primary web project during the past month. Noticing the absence of a free and modern learning platform
                for the Thai language (Duolingo and LiveMocha do not currently provide support), I began the application
                with the idea that I could improve my coding while providing something truly useful to the world at the same
                time. In addition to basic HTML/CSS/Javascript I implemented the ReactJS framework for its practical component
                based approach and Bootstrap for its flexibility and ease of use. With future growth in mind I leveraged
                React to make my code object-oriented and reusable and used Git to track my work and control revisions. As
                of January 16, 2017 I am proud to say that Thai Tutor provides value to its users with the following accomplishments:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaches Thai with audio, writing, and also English based phonetics</li>
                <li>Provides a powerful options menu which allows the student to focus their learning on their desired subject
                    and format</li>
                <li>Auto generates Thai numbers without need of any external API (fast and inexpensive for remote locations)</li>
                <li>Responsive design gives both mobile and desktop users an attractive UI</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Currently Thai Tutor runs as a solely client side single page application loading curriculum from a local JSON file but I
                am currently looking into creating a back end to provide the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User profiles and logins</li>
                <li>Database containing user statistics</li>
                <li>Potentially a connection to Google’s text to speech API, which is currently not officially supported. Google’s
                    supported Speech Synthesis API does not currently offer Thai</li>
            </ul>
