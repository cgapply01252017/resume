    <span class="title">Hello,</span>
    <br /><br /> The purpose of this page is to introduce myself as a web developer. It features an overview of my professional story, a copy of my current resume, and links to some of my recent web projects.
    <br /><br /> I graduated from UBC in 2014 with a Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical
    Engineering and shortly thereafter accepted a management position at a large industrial bakery (Weston Bakeries). Although
    I excelled in this role and gained satisfaction from my successes, I felt that this career path did not play to my strengths
    (or interests) and decided to leave my position this past summer after training my replacement.<br /><br /> I soon thereafter
    became interested in mobile applications but quickly moved to the broader world of web development, finding that the
    engineering skillset I gained from my undergrad applied surprisingly well to coding. More importantly, I found that I
    really enjoyed writing code, and I knew this was the career that I wanted to pursue. I began the project-based FreeCodeCamp
    curriculum in September and completed it in November, finishing the estimated 400+ hour program in six weeks. <br /><br
    /> Upon completion of the FreeCodeCamp Front-End program I began my personal project, Thai Tutor, a React based single
    page application largely inspired by the time I spent in Thailand from October to December of 2016. More details can
    be read at the ‘My Project’ page. My <a href="https://raddog25.github.io/weatherApp/"
        target="_blank">weatherApp</a> and <a href="https://raddog25.github.io/TicTacToe/" target="_blank">TicTacToeBot</a> are two smaller projects which better showcases my ability to handle AJAX and ES6. In addition to my core strength of javascript, I am also familar with Python and C++ and have setup basic servers in Node.js and PHP. <br /><br /> Although my professional
    experience as a developer is admittedly limited, I am positive that I can offer value that other candidates cannot. I
    am a ruthless problem solver who thrives when challenged, and am becoming a better web developer every single day. I am sure that a personal interview would better illustrate my qualifications for this role, so please do not hesitate in contacting me.
    <br /><br />
    Thank you for your consideration, <br />
    Chris

            <span class="title">Thai Tutor</span>
            <p>
                Thai Tutor has been my primary web project during the past month. Noticing the absence of a free and modern learning platform
                for the Thai language (Duolingo and LiveMocha do not currently provide support), I began the application
                with the idea that I could improve my coding while providing something truly useful to the world at the same
                time. In addition to basic HTML/CSS/Javascript I implemented the ReactJS framework for its practical component
                based approach and Bootstrap for its flexibility and ease of use. With future growth in mind I leveraged
                React to make my code object-oriented and reusable and used Git to track my work and control revisions. As
                of January 20, 2017 I am proud to say that Thai Tutor provides value to its users with the following accomplishments:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaches Thai with audio, writing, and also English based phonetics</li>
                <li>Provides a powerful options menu which allows the student to focus their learning on their desired subject
                    and format</li>
                <li>Auto generates Thai numbers up to 10000 without need of any external API (fast and inexpensive for remote locations)</li>
                <li>Responsive design gives both mobile and desktop users an attractive UI</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Currently Thai Tutor runs as a solely client side single page application loading curriculum from a local JSON file but I
                am currently looking into creating a back end to provide the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User profiles and logins</li>
                <li>Database containing user statistics</li>
                <li>Potentially a connection to Google’s text to speech API, which is currently not officially supported. Google’s
                    supported Speech Synthesis API does not currently offer Thai.</li>
            </ul>
